## Reflections and Comments

Most of the app was fairly straightforward; the main thing I am continuing to learn is that there are multiple way to accomplish the same task. I need to continue learning how best to make my code efficient, clean, and readable.

Adding the chart and removing button functionality has helped me to really understand what each section of code is doing. I need to keep things as simple as possible, whenever possible!
